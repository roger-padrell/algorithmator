# Algorithmator ![Completed 4/64](https://img.shields.io/badge/Completed-2/64-blue)
Visual representations of algorithms

They will be implemented using [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and [Drawim](https://github.com/GabrielLasso/drawim).

## List
A list of the algorithms implemented or to be implemented is available at [algorithms.md](algorithms.md)

## Usage
Use `nimble run item-name` to run an especific implementation or `nimble all` to get a list of all implementations.
